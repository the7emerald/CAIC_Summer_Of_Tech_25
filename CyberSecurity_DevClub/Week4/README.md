- **Authentication Testing** - Brute force, session attacks, password reset flaws
- **Authorization Testing** - Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation
- **Business Logic Testing** - Finding flaws in application workflows

### [API Security Testing](api-security.md)
Modern web applications are API-driven:
- **REST API Fundamentals** - Endpoints, methods, authentication
- **API Enumeration** - Finding hidden endpoints and parameters
- **API-Specific Attacks** - Mass assignment, rate limiting bypass, JWT attacks
- **GraphQL Security** - Query complexity attacks, introspection abuse
