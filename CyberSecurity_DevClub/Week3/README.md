# DevClub Cybersecurity Course ‚Äì Week 3 Resources
## Networking, Reconnaissance & OSINT

Welcome to Week 3! This week focuses on **reconnaissance** - the art of gathering information about targets without directly attacking them. You'll learn to map network infrastructure, discover hidden assets, and collect intelligence from public sources.

**Why Reconnaissance Matters:**
Reconnaissance is often the longest phase of any security assessment. It's where attackers (and defenders) map out the attack surface, identify potential entry points, and understand the target's digital footprint. The better your reconnaissance, the more targeted and effective your subsequent actions become.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will:
- Understand network fundamentals and how to systematically map infrastructure
- Use network scanning tools to discover live hosts and running services  
- Enumerate DNS records and discover subdomains effectively
- Gather intelligence from publicly available sources (OSINT)
- Automate reconnaissance workflows for efficiency and consistency
- Understand both offensive and defensive applications of these techniques

## Week 3 Topics Overview

**What is Reconnaissance?** Reconnaissance (recon) is the process of gathering information about a target system, network, or organization before conducting security testing. It's like doing research before an exam - the better your intel, the more effective your approach.

**Why Learn These Skills?** Modern cybersecurity professionals need to understand how attackers gather intelligence to:
- Identify and secure exposed assets
- Understand their organization's digital footprint
- Conduct security assessments and penetration tests
- Implement effective monitoring and detection systems

### [Networking Fundamentals](networking-fundamentals.md)
**What you'll learn:** How networks actually work and communicate
- **TCP/IP Basics** - The foundation of internet communication
- **Ports & Services** - How applications talk to each other
- **Network Tools** - Essential commands every security pro should know
- **Why it matters:** You can't secure what you don't understand

### [Network Scanning & Enumeration](network-scanning.md)
**What you'll learn:** How to discover and analyze network assets
- **Nmap Mastery** - The industry-standard network scanner
- **Service Detection** - Identifying what's running on discovered systems

**What you'll learn:** How to investigate domain infrastructure
- **DNS Deep Dive** - Understanding domain name resolution
- **Subdomain Discovery** - Finding hidden parts of organizations
- **Zone Transfers** - Exploiting DNS misconfigurations
