# Week 3: Infrastructure & Stakeholder Planning

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Translate your Week 2 mobility scenarios into tangible infrastructure and stakeholder strategies.
- Identify key players involved in planning and implementation.
- Outline high-level ideas for what infrastructure is needed, where it should go, and how it can be implemented realistically.

## 📌 Key Tasks

1. Stakeholder Overview  
   - Identify public, private, and community stakeholders relevant to your mobility strategy.  
   - Describe their roles and responsibilities (e.g., government bodies, transit agencies, utility providers, citizen groups).

2. Infrastructure Proposals  
   - Describe 3–5 key infrastructure interventions aligned with your city’s needs. These can include:  
     - Bus lanes or priority corridors  
     - EV charging stations  
     - Cycle lanes, pedestrian zones  
     - Mobility hubs or last-mile facilities  
   - For each intervention, explain:  
     - Why it’s needed  
     - Where it would ideally be located (general area or corridor)  
     - What its expected impact would be (on emissions, accessibility, etc.)

3. Feasibility Considerations  
   - Outline potential barriers and opportunities for implementation:  
     - Land availability  
     - Political support  
     - Budget estimates (broad categories: low/medium/high)  
   - Provide a basic sense of what can be done in the short, medium, and long term (no detailed timeline needed).

4. Connection to Your Scenario  
   - Explain how these infrastructure choices support the goals of your chosen 2030/2040 scenario.
