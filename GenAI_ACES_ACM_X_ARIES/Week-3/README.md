# Week 3

### 🔗 Learn About RAG ft. Qdrant  
**By: ARIES X ACES ACM**

---

## 🧠 Objective

This week, you will **dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using LangChain and Qdrant.

You'll understand how retrieval improves model outputs by connecting external information sources to LLMs, and how to implement it step-by-step.

> ✅ You **must submit** your **RAG implementation** using the **Case Compendium** below as the base knowledge document.

📄 **Case Compendium PDF (Required)**:  
[📥 Download Case Compendium](https://owncloud.iitd.ac.in/nextcloud/index.php/s/q97gkNsXzyC5wik?dir=undefined&openfile=12489814)

## 🧱 What You’ll Learn

### 🔍 RAG Core Concepts:
- What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?
- Chunking: splitting large docs into manageable parts  
- Embeddings: converting text into numerical vectors  
- Cosine Similarity: finding the most relevant chunks  
- Vector DBs: storing and querying using **Qdrant**

### 🕸 LangGraph Overview:
- LangGraph structure (nodes, edges, state)
- When to use LangGraph over plain LCEL
- Designing workflows as graphs

## 🧠 Tip of the Week

> “Start small. Focus on intuition. RAG isn’t about just querying—it's about retrieval intelligence.”
